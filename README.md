Create a simple page with one <canvas> element and a button:

Functionality:

- Allow adding lines by two clicks (first click creates the first position; then user moves the mouse and the line should be visible; if the user clicks left mouse button again the line should be added to image; if user starts drawing and presses right mouse button, don’t the line.

- If a line intersects show red  dot (independent of line status - creating or added) 
- When the user clicks “collapse lines”, the lines should be collapsed to the center of the line as a 3 second animation.
# Use:
  - OOP 
  - TypeScipt (preferred)  or  ES6
  - React (not too important)
